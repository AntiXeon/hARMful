TODO: V1.1:
===========
    * Utils: - Add CVector to vector support in C (similar to C++ STL ones)
             - Create CStrings as specialized CVectors

    * Close all threads on STOP_ON_ERRNO, ABORT, etc.

    * Improve threads creation / termination synchronisation :
        - All available threads are running, yet one (Ta) is being ending.
        - Its pointed function returns, but a new one (Tb) requires a new ID 
          before Ta pushes its ID.
        - Tb cannot be created while Ta is finished.

V1.0:
=====
    * Debug tools: Log system, printing coloured messages, basic condition
                   checking (C/C++)

    * Design patterns: Iterator, Observer, Singleton (C++ only)

    * Utils: Lists (C), pair lists (C/C++), string utils (C/C++), processor
             utils (C/C++), time utils (C/C++), threads manager (C/C++)
