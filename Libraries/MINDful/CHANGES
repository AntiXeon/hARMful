V1.0:
=====
    * Mathematics : - Math module to make some basic operations and some
                      algorithm from the C++11 standard. It allows the use of
                      similar API to C++11 without the need of a modern
                      compiler ;
                    - FastMath module is used to perform fast operations with
                      cached trigonometry results.

    * Geometry :    - Includes several classes used to manage some 2D elements,
                      such as points, lines and rectangles ;
                    - Basic support of 3D points.
