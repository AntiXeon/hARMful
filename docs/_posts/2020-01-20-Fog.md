Fog is a really simple effect to add in your scene. It is composed of a single framegraph node called `FogRenderNode` that does not need to be connected to other ones. No matter the order with other nodes, except the fact it must be accessible before the `FinalStepRenderingNode` node that performs the render.

Notice that the effect is compatible with a cubemap if you use one, as it does not override the cubemap texture.

The `FogRenderNode` takes different parameters:
* The color of the fog, that can fit the color of the world background (clear color or cubemap). The alpha channel is used to set the maximal intensity of the fog. Use 0 for no fog, 1 for a completely opaque fog;
* The distance from the camera from which the fog begins;
* The maximal distance that correspond to the distance from camera for which the fog intensity is maximal.

Here is the code sample to add fog in your scene:
```cpp
Hope::FrameGraphNode* rootFG = new Hope::FrameGraphNode() ;

//... Prepare your framegraph nodes...

// -- Fog effect --
new Hope::FogRenderNode(
    Hope::Color(0.4f, 0.5f, 0.6f, 1.f),     // RGB = color; A = intensity
    2.f,                                    // Minimal distance
    20.f,                                   // Maximal distance
    rootFG
) ;

//... Prepare your framegraph nodes...
```
