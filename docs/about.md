hARMful was - at its very beginning - an idea. It was the idea of a 3D video game I could never produce as it would be too complicated to create for a single developer. In this survival video game, the player was in danger in a very hostile environment.

Later, this idea became a little bit more concrete for a project at the engineering school on a Raspberry Pi. I compiled the Irrlicht game engine on this platform to create a small 3D application in splitscreen with a classmate. The aim was to control two players on the same computer with two keyboards and mouses. Moreover, I began to develop a kind of character behavior during this project. This was what hARMful looked like at this time: a naive video game artificial intelligence.

Yet, its name was found at this time. It is a pun between the idea of the video game staging harmful enemies and dangerous environments; and the ARM microcontroller unit of the Raspberry Pi.

Moreover, hARMful stands for "_Handy, Adapted to Raspi Multimedia and Fast Utilities Libraries_". For now, it is not yet adapted to the Raspberry Pi, but it is still a wish to run it on this small platform.

After the development of this first version of hARMful, I decided to continue this as a personal project. I added low-level functionalities as a logging system and mathematical tools. Some years later, I decided to simpify and rewrite these tools and to share it on GitHub. The hARMful project as you see it know was born.

The name of each library has a signification:
* **DOOM**: Debugging and Oriented-Object Modules
* **MIND**: Mathematics Interface to New Developments
* **HOPE**: Handy OpenGL and Physics Engines
* **SPITE**: Saving and Parsing Images, Texts and Extra

The logo of the engine is inspired by the pun of its name. It represents a *box jellyfish*  that is know to be a dangerous cube-shaped medusae. As one knows, cubes are among the simpliest shapes in 3D worlds, so that is symbolize my wish to create an easy-to-use 3D engine as well. But the representation of the box jellyfish is intented to remind a microcontroller unit as well with its numerous pins.

That's it, you know the secrets of the hARMful project!
