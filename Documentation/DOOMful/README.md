# Debugging and Oriented-Object Modules [DOOMful]
DOOMful provides several C++14 core utilities to all the other libraries from the **hARMful** project:
* A thread-safe console to write outputs on the console;
* A log system in both console and file(s);
* A profiler to measure the execution time of different parts of the code;
* Special arrays and additional data structures as a defragmented list, a list of pairs and a sized stack;
* A thread manager to easily handle them in a multithreaded application;
* System informations (CPU);
* Faster string operations than the standard C++ library implementation;
* And much more!
